    "Convolution, often denoted with $ \\circledast $ is a fundamental operation in signal processing, especially relevant in neurophysiological signal analysis. It involves combining two signals to form a third signal, illustrating how one signal modifies the other over time. Specifically, convolution is defined as **is defined as the integral of the product of the two functions after one is reversed and shifted.**. This is represented mathematically as follows:\n",

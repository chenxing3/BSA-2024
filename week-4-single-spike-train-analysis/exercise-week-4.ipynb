    "\n",
    "Last week we deduced the expression for $P_T(n)$ or the model we use for the probability that any sequence of $n$ spikes occurs within a trial of duration $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "After some inspection, we came up with the following result:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_T(n) = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\binom{M}{n}(r\\Delta t)^n(1 - r\\Delta t)^{M-n}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$P_T(n) = \\frac{(rT)^n}{n!} e^{-rT}$$\n",
    "\n",
